# Bourne Shell Examples
Some examples of Bourne shell scripts.

These scripts aren't useful on their own, but are more intended as examples
which can be modified into actually useful scripts. Most of the comments
within the scripts should probably be removed as they are only intended to
give extra context to someone unfamiliar with Bourne shell.

# Additional Resources
There is a fantastic tutorial that is a great resource for Bourne shell
specific behavior at [http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sh.html](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sh.html).


# Bugs, etc.
To report bugs or make feature requests (presumably new example scripts?),
please [make a GitHub issue](https://github.com/proidiot/bourne-shell-examples/issues).
